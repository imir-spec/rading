        <p>
            Teenage pregnancy is a significant social and health issue that affects young individuals worldwide.
            It often leads to challenges such as health risks for both the mother and baby, interrupted education, and financial difficulties. 
            Many factors contribute to teenage pregnancy, including lack of access to reproductive health education, peer pressure, and socioeconomic conditions.
            To address this issue, comprehensive sex education, access to contraception, and parental guidance are essential.
